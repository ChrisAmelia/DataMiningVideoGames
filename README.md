Playing video games is a **cool** thing. Wouldn't it also be cool that **you don't have to look for them**?  
What if *a certain thing* **suggests you automatically** games that you will most likely **love** and **play forever**?  
This is what this project is about: **video game recommendation based on your preferences**.
